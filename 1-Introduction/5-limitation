Limitations of JavaScript

    1. Security risks: JavaScript can be used to fetch data using AJAX or by manipulating tags that load data such as <img>, <object>, <script>. These attacks are called cross-site script attacks. They inject JS that is not part of the site into the visitorâ€™s browser thus fetching the details. 

    2. Performance: JavaScript does not provide the same level of performance as offered by many traditional languages as a complex program written in JavaScript would be comparatively slow. But as JavaScript is used to perform simple tasks in a browser, so performance is not considered a big restriction in its use.

    3. Complexity: To master a scripting language, programmers must have a thorough knowledge of all the programming concepts, core language objects, and client and server-side objects otherwise it would be difficult for them to write advanced scripts using JavaScript.

    4. Weak error handling and type checking facilities: It is a weakly typed language as there is no need to specify the data type of the variable. So wrong type checking is not performed by compile.
