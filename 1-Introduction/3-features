Features of JavaScript

According to a recent survey conducted by Stack Overflow, JavaScript is the most popular language on earth. 
With advances in browser technology and JavaScript having moved into the server with Node.js and other frameworks, JavaScript is capable of so much more. Here are a few things that we can do with JavaScript: 

    JavaScript was created in the first place for DOM manipulation. Earlier websites were mostly static, after JS was created dynamic Web sites were made.
    Functions in JS are objects. They may have properties and methods just like other objects. They can be passed as arguments in other functions.
    Can handle date and time.
    Performs Form Validation although the forms are created using HTML.
    No compiler is needed.

// Features 

    1. High-level Language: JavaScript is a high-level programming language, meaning it is designed to be human-readable and easy to understand.

    2. Interpreted: JavaScript is an interpreted language, meaning that code is executed line by line, without the need for a compilation step. Browsers have built-in JavaScript engines to interpret and execute JavaScript code.

    3. Dynamic Typing: JavaScript is dynamically typed, allowing variables to hold values of any data type without requiring explicit declaration of the data type.

    4. Prototype-based Object-Oriented: JavaScript uses prototype-based inheritance rather than class-based inheritance. Objects can inherit properties and methods directly from other objects.

    5. Functions as First-class Citizens: In JavaScript, functions are treated as first-class citizens, meaning they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions, returned from functions, and stored in data structures.

    6. Event-driven and Asynchronous: JavaScript is designed to handle events triggered by user interactions or other sources asynchronously, allowing for non-blocking operations. This is crucial for building responsive and interactive web applications.

    7. Cross-platform Compatibility: JavaScript is supported by all major web browsers and can run on various platforms, including desktop, mobile, and server environments.

    8. Client-Side Scripting: JavaScript is primarily used for client-side scripting, enabling dynamic content manipulation, form validation, and interaction with web APIs within web browsers.

    9. Server-Side Development: With the introduction of environments like Node.js, JavaScript can also be used for server-side development, allowing developers to build scalable and efficient web servers and backend services.

    10. Rich Ecosystem: JavaScript has a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, such as React, Angular, and Vue.js for front-end development, as well as Express.js, Nest.js, and Hapi.js for backend development, which streamline development and provide additional functionality.

    11. Modularity: JavaScript supports modularity through mechanisms like ES6 modules and CommonJS, allowing developers to organize code into reusable and maintainable modules.

    12. Support for Functional Programming: JavaScript supports functional programming paradigms, allowing developers to write concise, expressive, and composable code using features like higher-order functions, closures, and lambda expressions.
