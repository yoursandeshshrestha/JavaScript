HTTP response status codes

HTTP response status codes indicate whether a specific HTTP request has been successfully completed. 
Responses are grouped in five classes:

    Informational responses (100 – 199)
    Successful responses (200 – 299)
    Redirection messages (300 – 399)
    Client error responses (400 – 499)
    Server error responses (500 – 599)

some of the most important HTTP response status codes along with their meanings:

    200 OK:
        Indicates that the request has succeeded. The response generally includes the requested resource.

    201 Created:
        Indicates that the request has been fulfilled and a new resource has been created as a result of it. Typically used in POST requests.

    204 No Content:
        Indicates that the server has successfully processed the request but there is no content to return.

    400 Bad Request:
        Indicates that the server cannot process the request due to a client error, such as malformed syntax or invalid request parameters.

    401 Unauthorized:
        Indicates that authentication is required and has failed or has not yet been provided.

    403 Forbidden:
        Indicates that the server understood the request but refuses to authorize it. Typically, this means the user does not have the necessary permissions to access the resource.

    404 Not Found:
        Indicates that the server could not find the requested resource. This is a common error when the requested resource does not exist.

    405 Method Not Allowed:
        Indicates that the request method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) is not supported for the requested resource.

    500 Internal Server Error:
        Indicates that the server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.

    503 Service Unavailable:
        Indicates that the server is currently unable to handle the request due to temporary overloading or maintenance of the server.
